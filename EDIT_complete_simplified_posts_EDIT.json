        "title": "Flash Sale at Seneca Lake Ford Lincoln Mercury with a lightly used Chrysler semi-tracked Dragoon Six-Alpha Prowler featuring the TRW 1200 RDO Pulsed Qbit Mains both front and rear. This rig has the extended range conformal tanks (not pictured) and a fast-starting INS that achieves gimbal lock in less than 5 minutes, even in cold weather (pictured) conditions, and GC in no time, getting you from start-up to chocks-pulled quicker and with fewer headaches. Current configuration is a significant up-res from Red Rouge Factory \u00e2\u0080\u009cstock\u00e2\u0080\u009d builds. This custom job will sleep 8-10 comfortably in four Fendi Casa designed live-work rack rooms, all with 28.8 Gbps feeds with integral Hayes-Borsalino data hubs that flange perfectly to an array of Nakamichi S-Band, Ky-Band, and Ku-Band uplink/downlinks that are individually accessible from the main comms and assay stations \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0all in their own separate work rooms, with Hawker-Siddeley 8080i UV, Rad, Emissive, Acoustic, and Mechanical Shock isolation bays for each. Newly refurbished anterior localized with the Teledyne Semiconduction SiO2 gate oxide control and adoption isometric task queuing system ensures that your \u00e2\u0080\u009clazy\u00e2\u0080\u009d gimbal drift is minimized to less than 0.02% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even in magnetic field dead/dry zones. With a gate voltage attractor, voltage controlled channel conductance, and high-k dielectrics, this autonomous navigator has all the modifications that long-range EV operators have been demanded since the challenges of operating below the 42nd. (Hathaway Trinav unit coming next season for retrofits when compatible!)\n\nPerfect expedition or adventure vehicle for serious assay in and around the partial and newly opened containment geographies, or just for prowling your FOB perimeter, checking up on the spread, or retrieving errant, malfunctioning or lost equipment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone out on the range.\nThis Six-Alpha won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last. So come down today or tomorrow to lock this deal in.

The Super 8-1080p is a paragon of reliability, durability, and self-maintenance, the result of a rapid and intense collaboration between John Deere, Coleco, and Hasbro, led by some of the top Farm Tech Administrators.\nWhere the rubber meets the field, the Super 8-1080p makes solid contact with the toothy Pirelli HiToe L40 tires, meticulously designed to adjust grip based on the moisture content in the soil, providing unmatched traction across parched and sodden terrain. These same tires are integrated with Panasonic TriTip floatation rebreathers, giving the Super 8-1080p the ability to perform field float harvesting when the weather conditions demand, meaning you can operate 24/7.\nThe Super 8-1080p operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabin is built around the Sony ICF-5900, converting incoming signaling into an \u00e2\u0080\u009cIF\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Intermediate Fractional offering superlative terrain follow and obstacle avoidance. The Operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Control Center delivers crisply integrated piloting, auto-piloting, and semi-auto-piloting capabilities to make easy work of long harvesting deployments.\nBut wait - the new Super 8-1080i build features a rear pilot bay accessible through the spacious main corridor to assist with tricky docking procedures.\nA TDK AgriVue interface integrates seamlessly through the Grass Valley 4000A switcher allowing V.24 28.8 uplinks for trad comms and OTA firmware updates.\nAvailable today at Ronny, Morgan & Stanley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Heavy Rentals.

        "title": "Barker Sons Downtown Chrysler Kia Mercedes is now taking pre-orders for 3 brand new Mercedes AMG MOS Tech 6502E low field expedition-ready overland comms relay and reconnaissance vessels, due by the end of the season. The MOS features a dramatically simplified internal layout and architecture compared to the previous edition, the 6502C. The E build now includes several internal registers in every passageway and room, including an accumulator (A) readily accessible in the cockpit, and a PC in both the galley and entertainment room.\nThis latest model MOS includes the MOSFET PNP instruction set accessible from the redesigned mnemonics built right into the cockpit MFD, including the re-engineered Add with Carry (ADC) and Branch if Not Equal (BNE) in the Outboard Display Unit.\nDrawing from Northrup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s century of expertise, the all glass CPUs maximize situation awareness making operations as easy as taking a nap, leaving more time to luxuriate on the upper decks. The sumptuous L\u00c3\u00bcrssen entertainment room features an Olhausen pool table and Roche Bobois sofas and the prized Honeywell 80386 laboratory & machine shop. \nBelow deck is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the secret to the durability, reliability and range of the MOS: a pair of Volvo Heavy Lift twin hydoxinol gravity-fed TurboRage\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 primes, each with 32 tri-axle plasma corridors. When out on a long deployment without access to repair facilites, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll appreciate the expansive compartment from the adjoining bunkhouse.\nPre-orders with 50% deposits accepted via all major certified chains directly to Barker Sons Downtown and plus pls indicate in the data payload your delivery details and EAN.\n\n#designfiction\n#speculativedesign\n#nearfuturedesign\n#nearfuturelaboratory\n#futuresdesign\n#aidesign\n#conceptdesign\n#automotivedesign\n#design\n#designinspiration\n#generativedesign\n#industrialdesign\n#automotivedesign",

This is the W200 that was featured on Hot Spots last year that found fresh water just south of Graeta Fells, so a bit of history here. \nTypical Wirtgen signature quad axle set up with a unique internal bearing drive at each wheel, each powered directly from 8 isolated cores from the liqud cooled 7950X, which sits in a titanium casing just aft of axle 2 to make this an incredibly survivable and well-protected work horse.\nExterior does not give any clue as to the sumptuous interior package that is simply barely suited to a prose-based description so just take a look at the images taken by the great W.E.

Bear 0-360s were fitted with quite minimal state rooms, consisting largely of simple plywood platform with a custom fabricated double-sized H\u00c3\u00a4stens Vividus mattress and, as the 0-360s do not have laundry facilities, we installed Katabatic Gear Palisade sleeping bags, with a quilt-style design for versatility and customization. Like the H\u00c3\u00a4stens Vividus, the Katabatic is fitted to the preferences of each team member.\nThe kitchen is built on the principles of austerity & ease of use and as such consists of an Amana Radarange Microwave Oven and Bottom-Freezer Refrigerator. Together with an IKEA NORDEN extendable dining table, you have versatile and practical options for meetings, meals, and gatherings when inviting guests or foot-mobile explorers.

The local memetypes and other insurgencies are killing the zeal. They just joke around. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so annoying. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to do something real here, and the weird $INSCRUTABLES and $SHIB factions and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me started with the $DOGE. I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a joke anymore. Is it? No. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.
